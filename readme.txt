with greetings and respect
I have other ideas about how to better store data in the database, such as considering a separate table for the user and connecting it to the account table through a foreign key. Also checking the availability of the user when registering the relevant user accounts.
Due to the lack of time, I will postpone these items to you so that I can implement them if needed.
If necessary, I would be grateful if you could raise this issue
with respect
